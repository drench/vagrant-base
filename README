This is a generic vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) setup

I originally used fabriceb's Symfony VM setup as a base, stripped it
down, and started building from that.

The 'base' branch is just that: a base. It runs no services, and
has no extras. The interesting stuff is in the branches that build
from this.

Let's say you want a generic "LAMP" server.

Follow the instructions here:

http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/

When you get to the "Test on a first project" section, do this instead:

% git clone git://github.com/drench/vagrant-base.git -b lamp lamp
% cd lamp
% vagrant up
