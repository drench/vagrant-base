This is a vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) Drupal 6 setup

I used fabriceb's Symfony VM setup as a base.

To try it, follow the instructions here:

http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/

When you get to the "Test on a first project" section, do this instead:

% git clone git://github.com/drench/vagrant-base.git -b drupal6 drupal6
% cd drupal6
% vagrant up

Point your favorite browser at http://localhost:2011/install.php to complete
your Drupal 6 installation.
