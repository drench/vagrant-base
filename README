This is a vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) LAMP setup

I used fabriceb's Symfony VM setup as a base.

To try it, follow the instructions here:

http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/

When you get to the "Test on a first project" section, do this instead:

% git clone git://github.com/drench/vagrant-base.git -b lamp lamp
% cd lamp
% vagrant up

Once you get your prompt back, you can ssh into your VM:

% vagrant ssh

Point your favorite browser at http://localhost:2011/ to verify
that your Linux-Apache-Mysql-Php is running.
