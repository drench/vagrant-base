This is a vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) setup with node.js v0.4.5.

I used fabriceb's Symfony VM setup as a base.

To try it, follow the instructions here:

http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/

When you get to the "Test on a first project" section, do this instead:

% git clone git://github.com/drench/vagrant-base.git -b node node
% cd node
% vagrant up

Since you're compiling node.js from source, it may take a while.

Once you get your prompt back, ssh into your VM:

% vagrant ssh

Then run the example node "app":

% /vagrant/hello.js

Point your favorite browser at http://localhost:2011/ to verify
that it worked.
