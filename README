This is a vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/) setup that installs Reddit

I originally used fabriceb's Symfony VM setup as a base, stripped it
down, and started building from that.

The 'base' branch is just that: a base. It runs no services, and
has no extras. The interesting stuff is in the branches that build
from this.

Follow the instructions here:

http://www.theodo.fr/blog/2011/03/start-using-vagrant/

When you get to the "Test on a first project" section, do this instead:

% git clone git://github.com/drench/vagrant-base.git -b reddit reddit
% cd lamp
% vagrant up

It will run the latest "install-reddit.sh" for you.

After installation completes, you can load test data as described here:

https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/reddit-install-script-for-Ubuntu

% vagrant ssh
% sudo bash
# sudo -H -u reddit bash
% paster shell run.ini
>>> from r2.models import populatedb
>>> populatedb.populate()

This may take a while.
When it's done, point your browser at http://localhost:2011/
